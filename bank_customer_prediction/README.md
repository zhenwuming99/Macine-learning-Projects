## üìÅ About The Data Folder

This project is actually divided into three parts:

  1.built the machine learning model to predict the type of card the customer may issue.

  2.built a Web application on the Django to mount the prediction model.

  3.Deployed the Diango project on Heroku through github.
	
## Dataset 
The data set in particular has a lot of columns, it contains how much the card is being

used, on what basis the card is being used, how much the customer is paying for that and if customer wants to renew the card or maybe upgrade.

All of that type of information is present.
